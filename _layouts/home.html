      <h3><span>Power of Peers Circles &amp; Coaching Program</span></h3>
        <div class=graph>
         The Power of Peers (POP) Circles and Coaching Program is a career development program designed to transform your life and propel your career forward. 
        </div>
        <div class="graph">
          <span class="question">What is a POP Circle?</span> POP Circles are virtual peer communities that meet every other week. The program includes three facilitated POP Circle meetings, ongoing access to your POP Circle, and two individual coaching sessions. 
        </div> 
        <div class="graph">
          <span class="question">Why join?</span> Women excel when they have access to informal networks, community, and a tight circle of successful peers as they navigate bias and challenging institutions. POP Circle participation provides access to accountability, community, empowerment, and ongoing connection. Your circle will be a professional space for confidential conversations about the intersection of who you are personally, professionally, and the role of your social identities in your experience.
        </div>
        <div class="graph">
          <span class="question">Who is in your POP circle?</span> Join five to ten individuals at a similar career stage in STEM and work together to propel your careers forward. We help build the POP Circle you want and need so you can have a space with peers with whom you share identities - like gender, race, ethnicity, LGBQT, among others - that are most salient to your career and life. 
        </div>
        <div class="graph">
          <span class="question">What are the benefits?</span>
  <ul><li>A community of peers to leverage for support, feedback, and ideas throughout your career.

    <h4 class=testimonial_header">POP Circle &amp; Coaching Testimonials</h4>
<div class="testimonial">
[This] is often a lonely profession, and our circle makes me feel much less alone. Now that I have my POP circle to validate my struggles, help me work through a range of challenges, and celebrate exciting milestones with me, I look forward to our next call the moment the current one is over. 
</div>
<div class="star-sep"></div>
<div class="testimonial">
POP Circles provides the unique opportunity to balance focus on the everyday problems that have big impacts on our well-being as professionals and human beings and the challenge to take on longer term discussions around the big issues with which we all wrestle. 
</div>
<div class="star-sep"></div>
<div class="testimonial">
The POP group has been an incredible place for growth &amp; connection... 
I love how each of us come from different types of ... institutions, yet we all meet each other beautifully in our struggles, advice, and desire for growth. 
It has been so comforting to find that I'm not alone is some of the basic struggles I feel I should have overcome by now (like time management!), and to have people reflect back on me my own accomplishments allows me to talk back to that imposter syndrome attitude and see that I really do belong in the field of scientists. 
I so love the depth and heart that we are able to bring to the conversation, and how much we are able to gently nudge each other forward. In the year we have worked together, I have seen so much growth in each person, both professionally and personally, it is a gorgeous thing to see! 
This group has been pivotal for me in allowing me to see how much more I have to offer, and I have done, than I had been giving myself credit for... 
Thank you for the courage to stand in my strength, the supportive community that helps me lean in (and lean back) when I need to, and the tools that help me do it all even better. You are a game-changer Claire.
